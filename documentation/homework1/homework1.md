# Homework 1

Building UI using basic widgets(buttons and textViews) and layout managers such as LinearLayout

# Functionality

* The UI layout is given some functionality as a simple TODO app.

* The first editText is used to filter TODO entries.

* The second editText and button are used to add new TODO entry.

* The scrollView is used to display TODOS along with a button to delete an entry.

* The bottom button is used to delete all TODO entries.

# Bonus features

* The TODO entries are stored in file. Currently, the way it is implemented is: a list of TODO
entries is maintained in-memory, and on each modification(add or delete), the list is dumped
in a file.
